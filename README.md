# ML-Insurance-Cost-Prediction

An end-to-end machine learning project to predict insurance costs using data preprocessing, feature engineering, standardization, and linear regression.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project aims to build a complete machine learning pipeline to predict insurance charges based on various features such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, salary, and medical history.

The project covers the full workflow of a real-world ML problem:
- Data cleaning
- Outlier handling
- Categorical encoding
- Feature scaling (standardization)
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Model evaluation using RMSE and R² score
- Visualization of predicted vs actual values

## 📈 Model Performance

- **R² Score:** ~96.9%
- **RMSE:** (Add your value here)

The model explains approximately **96.9% of the variance** in insurance charges, which indicates a strong fit.
